    "You work at an e-commerce company that sells three goods: widgets, doodads, and fizzbangs. The head of advertising asks you which they should feature in their new advertising campaign. You have data on individual visitors' sessions (activity on a website, pageviews, and purchases), as well as whether or not those users converted from an advertisement for that session. You also have the cost and price information for the goods."

    "To gain statisticaly compelling results, I'd use the site analytics on a per-good basis. Starting with the most advertisment-convert prone, I'd put together reports providing insight into advertisment's impact on user's site activity and ultimately their procliving to purchase. Things like 1\\. how/when advertisements were used in way that led to beneficial site activity 2\\.which of the products may or may not be selling more without advertisements and 3\\.Which product makes the most money(and recieves the most attention) regardless of avertisement. \n",

The onboarding funnel has three steps: email and password signup, plan choice, and payment. On a user level you have information on what steps they have completed as well as timestamps for all of those events for the past 3 years. You also have information on marketing spend on a weekly level."

    "Understanding that the growth of new clients is slowing; my first goal with the provided data would be to identify which, if any, of the boarding funnel steps is acting like a bottleneck. This insight can paint a picture of how plan choices and costs/payment may be affecting our aquisition of users. I'd be interested in things like time spent on each section and attempt to associate delays/underiable actions with some front end language or naunce. \n",
    "\n",
    "After hopefully identifying some solvable issues with the onboarding process, I'd move on to the marketing data. I'd guess that this data will provide the majority of insight into user acquisition. Of course, confirming that would be one of the first things to look at with this data (confirming 1:1 relationship between weekly-marketing expenditure and user signups). Quite significantly, if the current drop in user acquisition is due to a lack of marketing than that would take center stage in my report. Beyond that, I would take a look at how varying levels of spending have impacted user signups. I'd use statistics to determine the significance/correlation with dollars spent and users added. These results would be summarized to provide guidance into the different thresholds of marketing and when/how much spending would be most beneficial.  \n",

Specifically, a attempt would be made to connect user's activity with another potential ranking system. I'd create hypotetical ranking systems for hotel data such as their rating, previous bookings through our website, or distance from signifant locations. I would then compare user activity (mainly page views) to these hypothetical ranking systems.
