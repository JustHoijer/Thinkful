    "Drill: Formulating good research questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorize each of the following research questions as \"good\" or \"bad\", and provide alternative formulations for the bad ones. Save your responses in a document of some kind, submit a link below, and discuss your reasoning with your mentor.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. What is the 1994 rate of juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?\n",
    "\n",
    "Altough alittle simple, this seems like a \"good\" research question. Provided the data exists, a simple mathematical model can be used to determine the rate of juvenile dlinquency. Using a 'per time' or 'per standard' approach, this question can be answered using a numeric solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. What can we do to reduce juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question seems alittle vague. There might be too many factors that contribute to juvenile delinquency for a mathematical model to accuracly answer this question. Given data related to attributing factors, one might be able to determine which facor/factors can be focused on. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Does education play a role in reducing juvenile delinquents' return to crime?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is definitly a \"good\" research question. It is both direct and mathemically solvable. Given the data, a relationship can be easily drawn between education proceeding crime and a return to crime. The results could include probabilities or quantities. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. How many customers does AT&T currently serve in Washington, DC?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a \"bad\" research question. Just a number from a dataset doesn't require any mathematical modeling. Even if the data population was larger than just the D.C area, the answer is not one that requires any statistic modeling. An alternative might be to determine the proportion of people AT&T serves in the area. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. What factors lead consumers to choose AT&T over other service providers?\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems alittle hard to pin-down. I'm not sure a dataset exists that accounts for all the possible factors related to this question. However, if there were a subset of designated factors, then I'm sure that some quantifiable result could be found. \n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. How can AT&T attract more customers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, given that data exists for the current customer acquisition techiques; This seems like a \"good\" research question. By determining how resources can be better allocated, a proper action plan (including probabilities) can be created for the attraction of new customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "7\\. Why did the Challenger Shuttle explode?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd say this is a \"bad\" research question. Assuming that there is only one cause for the explosion, finding the reason would be just a check list. The cause or \"variable\" probabily doesn't have many underlying processes that contributed to the explosion(in my infinite ignorance). \n",
    "Even if the malfunction has a long list of preceeding events, it seems to be that a mathematical model would be generally insignificant. \n",
    "\n",
    "8\\. Which genes are associated with increased risk of breast cancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a \"good\" research question. Insights gained from a pertinent dataset would be ripe with statistical signicance. \n",
    "\n",
    "9\\. Is it better to read to children at night or in the morning?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a \"bad\" research question since the value of \"better\" can't be quantified. Not only is the likely hood of this data existing pretty low, I can't determine any \"real\" significance. As an alternative, if a specific outcome was put into question (such as material retention), than this could be a good research question. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10\\. How does Google’s search algorithm work?\n",
    "\n",
    "This could go either way. If an experiment was designed to collect data an determine the algorith without direct data from google, then I'd say this is a \"good\" research question. Otherwise, this seems like a case of reinventing the wheel. I'm pretty sure google doesn't keep it's algorithms private..\n",
