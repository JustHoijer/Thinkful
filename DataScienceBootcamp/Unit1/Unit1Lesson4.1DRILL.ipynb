    "1. Using the basis of A/B testing, I set out to gather metrics on both users of the supplement and a placebo/non-users(Two-versions). The sample of participants would be randomly selected from supplement users and for the placebo users. Since participates who are in need of sleep remedies, both samples would have to come from the \"in-need\" population. I would set out to disprove/prove (find evidence to support or deny) that the supplement leads to better sleep. I would compare things like sleep-hours, sleep-schedule, and restfulness through surveys. The key metric in this case would be hours slept. Using the explained metrics, one could determine if the supplement could be responsible for \"better\" sleep."

    "2\\. For this question I would see if I could find existing data/senerios where a change in uniform did and didn't occur. The two versions would be gyms where one changed their uniforms and one where they didn't; idealy the gyms would be of similar size and target the same demographic as the gym trying to decide. (This seems impossible... this data does not exist). anyway, my hypothesis would be that a change in uniform had a possible effect on client joins and retension. To do this I would look at how new uniforms affected things like sign-up rates, time-spent at the gym, and client satisfaction. The key metric in this case would be new sign up rates, as it is the most pertinent when judging \"good for business\". \n"

    "3\\. Hypothesis: The new homepage will lead to more exotic pet rentals. If one could setup the two homepages to operate simultaneously, where anyone who goes to the sign as a random chance of being directed to either verion, metrics could be gathered to support or deny the hypothesis. The homepage could affect things like time spent, click, and most importantly rentals. "

    "4\\. This example is much like the one given in the curriculum. Two versions of the same email could be sent out with the only difference being the 'please read' in the subject. While maintaining similar samples, the \"all on\" or \"all off\" approach would be used to determine the more dominate version in terms of readership. "
