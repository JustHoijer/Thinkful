    "- You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.\n",
    "- You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.\n",
    "- You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week."

    "2\\. Initially, these results seem legitement. However, the clearly the people who visit the clinic have higher levels of anxiety than the average person. The sample is not a random split when comparing the general population to a select group of axiety prone individuals. Not only do the samples paint an inherently biased picture, it could be argued that people at the clinic would be more willing or comfortable with rating their anxiety at higher levels."

    "3\\. The bias in this example include outside factors and disputable results. The rise in website visits could be the result of outside factors or coincidence. More context would be needed to understand the imapct of the billboards; things like visability, location, and impact. Without making a connection between sample size and website visits, its hard to creating any meaningful connection. "

Without important metrics like the number of program signups, the frequency of member visits, and other factors that may effect member visits; it's impossible to make informed conclusions about the validity of the loyalty program. \n"
